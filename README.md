Repo for the work on my senior essay for S&amp;DS with Prof. Gillingham

The output data is stored in the Dropbox "Solar_ElectricData" and combines the data from that was used in "The Heterogeneous Value of Solar and Wind Energy: Empirical Evidence from the United States and Europe. M Ovaere, K Gillingham. Working paper, 2019."

The combined total data files are stored in the folder "ISOs"

CAISO, NYISO, ERCOT, ISONE, PJM are all completed and should be combined and up to date.

- All the data here is averaged across the hubs and aggregated to the hour level.

MISO has a file; however, the generation by type is not correct given the formating of the raw data.

SPP does not have a file because I could not find the Hubs to average. This was done using S&P global in the past, but we did not use S&P global for the updating.
